# Mazes
Exercises from Jamis Buck's "Mazes for Programmers."

Chapter 1 is just an overview - the code starts in Chapter 2. Although this is a continuous project for the most part, I'm going to break it up by chapter for natural break points and goals. This leads to some code duplication and obfuscates the evolution of the core classes, of course.

I worked through this book a few years ago in C# (unfortunately not checked in, need to see if I can locate that code). But for this effort, I'll work through in Ruby per the book text.
